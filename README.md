🔌 Power Fault Detection Using Machine Learning
A capstone project focused on using machine learning techniques to detect and classify faults in power distribution systems. Developed and deployed as part of an internship using IBM Watson Machine Learning on IBM Cloud Lite.

📌 Problem Statement
Traditional fault detection methods in power distribution networks are slow, reactive, and unreliable. This project addresses the need for a smarter, faster, and more accurate fault detection system using real-time electrical and environmental data.

✅ Proposed Solution
This project uses machine learning to:

Detect power faults in real time

Reduce downtime by enabling predictive maintenance

Enhance reliability of the power grid
